OpenMC
=========

OpenMC is a 3rd party minecraft launcher designed for the managing of multiple minecraft installations. It features support for several mod loaders and the ability to download modpacks from several popular platforms. 

## Development
OpenMC is built on Qt5 and C++ primarily.

If you want to help out, open an issue or fork it and create a pull request.

### Building
If you want to build OpenMC yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

## Collaboration Policy
OpenMC is created by the community, for the community. Features are community driven and if enough people request it, it'll probably be implemented.

### Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general:
* Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule
* Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializators...) as lists, not paragraphs.
* Optimize for readability

## Forking/Redistributing
OpenMC welcomes forks, although we would prefer if you clarify that it is a fork. The name and logo are also goverened under the Apache 2 license that this project is distributed under and as suck are available for use assuming credit is given
